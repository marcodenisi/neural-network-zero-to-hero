# 🧠 Neural Networks: Zero to Hero – Exercises

This repository contains my hands-on implementations and experiments from [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/)'s excellent **"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"** course. The series focuses on building neural networks from scratch, understanding backpropagation, and training models without relying on high-level libraries.

> "This course is for people who want to understand and implement neural nets at the lowest level." — Karpathy
